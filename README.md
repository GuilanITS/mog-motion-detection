# Motion detection by MOG Background Subtraction
Background Subtraction is a commonly used method to segment moving parts from static scenes. The moving regions which contain edges of vehicles are detected by subtracting the current frame of the video from a reference static background. The reference background creation process is known as background modeling. The background model must be continuously updated and contain no moving objects.
One of the extensions to the common background subtraction method is **Mixture of Gaussian (MOG)** background subtraction that is dependent to a combination of frames instead of only one frame. In this method, for each background pixel, a mixture of k Gaussian distribution and a weighting parameter are utilized to save the lifetime of pixels in the scene. Thus, remaining pixels with more than a threshold time in the scene means they have the higher possibility of belonging to the background scene. On the other hand, if the pixel remains unchanged for a period of time, it is considered as a dominant background pixel.
To update the model, MoG method can be used as an online approximation scale. If the difference of pixels in a frame is more than a predefined threshold, they are classified as moving parts. This method is very sensitive to changes in the environment.

### Environment
The application is implemented by C# programming language and utilizes AForge.Net and EmguCV image processing libraries.

### Sample Output
A sample output of the application is presented in below image. As it can be seen, calibration of the input video to omit any existing noises is really important.
